# PipeExchange

This is a submission for the GMTK Game Jam
The topic was "A game without its main mechanic" 

## My interpretation

Everybody knows the Pipe connection games where you are tasked with rearanging the pipes to allow water flow from start to the goal. But what if you dont see those pipes (i am just not enough of an artist to draw them ^^)? 

As a result you need other creative ways of figuring out how to connect up the world. (DISCLAIMER the game is still buggy as hell)

You can smash floor tiles to see when water is flowing through. Open holes in the ground can show you where pipes are leaking and if the time had allowed, you would be able to grow a tree with the overflowing water.
