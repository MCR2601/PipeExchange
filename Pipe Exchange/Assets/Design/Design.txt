Design of Pipe Exchange by Marc 'MCR' Reiterer
===================================================

This game was created for the Game Makers toolkit game jam 2018
Theme: Genre without mechanic
The game has to resemble a genre but has to leave out something very essenstial we all assosiate with it


The IDEA of PipeExchange:

Genre: Pipe Connecting Game
--> You have to connect pipes to allow something to flow from Point A to Point B

The mechanic left out:
--> You can not see the pipes because there is concrete above them *duh*
--> Only way to know where the water is flowing is to break concrete tiles, which will lock the pipe in place and show you when it is getting water + on the side of the map

--> you can plant trees on tiles without a pipe --> if a pipe pums water into it the tree will grow


Tiles will be sprites size
32x32 with usually a 1 pixel large border for easier visability



----------------
Yes i just didnt want to draw the pipes i admit it
